When an alarm activates, you know which zone but not the exact detector. Addressable systems give each detector a unique address, allowing you to identify the exact location of an alarm. Addressable systems are more expensive but provide better information and are required for larger buildings."},{category:"installation",question:"Can I install the fire alarm system myself?",answer:"While some simple systems can be self-installed, we strongly recommend professional installation for complete fire alarm systems. This ensures proper system design, correct detector placement, and reliable operation. We can connect you with certified installers in your area."},{category:"installation",question:"How many smoke detectors do I need for my building?",answer:"The number depends on your building size, layout, ceiling height, and local regulations. As a general guide, one detector covers approximately 100m² in open areas. You will also need detectors in corridors, stairwells, and specific risk areas. Our technical team can help you calculate the exact requirements for your building."},{category:"installation",question:"What type of cable should I use for fire alarm installation?",answer:"Fire alarm systems require fire-resistant cables that maintain circuit integrity during a fire. We recommend FP200, FP200 Gold, or equivalent fire-resistant cables for most installations. The specific cable type depends on your system design and local regulations. Our team can advise on the correct specification."},{category:"technical",question:"How often should fire alarm systems be tested?",answer:"Regular testing is essential. We recommend: Weekly - test one call point and verify the alarm sounds; Monthly - full system test including all detectors and sounders; Annually - professional inspection and servicing by a qualified technician. Keep detailed records of all tests as required by regulations."},{category:"technical",question:"What causes false alarms and how can I prevent them?",answer:"Common causes include dust accumulation, steam from kitchens or bathrooms, aerosol sprays, and incorrect detector placement. Prevention: regular cleaning and maintenance, use heat detectors in kitchens, avoid placing detectors near bathrooms or air vents, and ensure proper detector selection for each area."},{category:"technical",question:"How long do fire alarm detectors last?",answer:"Most smoke and heat detectors have a lifespan of 10 years, after which they should be replaced regardless of apparent functionality. Control panels typically last 15-20 years with proper maintenance. Always check manufacturer specifications and replace components at the end of their rated life."},{category:"ordering",question:"How do I place an order?",answer:'Simply browse our products and click "Order on WhatsApp" on any product page. This will open WhatsApp with the product details pre-filled. You can also contact us directly via WhatsApp, phone, or email with your requirements.

Standard delivery takes 2-3 business days. For urgent orders, express delivery options are available. Large bulk orders may require additional lead time, which we will confirm when you place your order."},{category:"ordering",question:"What payment methods do you accept?",answer:"We accept all major payment methods including bank transfer, credit/debit cards, and for established business customers, we can arrange account terms.
